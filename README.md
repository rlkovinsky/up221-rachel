## profile
Hi all! My name is Rachel, and I'm a first year MURP concentrating in Design & Development and also part of the double degree program with Sciences Po. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, but I spent the last seven years living up in the Bay Area. Most recently, I worked in communications and development at a parks nonprofit - but in a greater sense, I'm passionate about building a more sustainable and just future within the urban environment. My interests within the planning field focus on access to urban greenspaces, active transportation, and environmental justice. I'm looking forward to *attempting* to code alongside you all!
## course description
From my understanding, this course is designed to teach us how to critically analyze and visualize spatial data in the context of planning practices and research. Throughout the quarter, we will be challenged to look at urban data and answer the question: how can data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? 
## project ideas
I'm still workshopping ideas, but a few topics that I would be interested to explore further include: the relationship between air quality and access to parks within a city; analyzing data on urban heat and median income; and mapping the relationship between life expectancy and urban canopy. I'm interested in the larger intersection of health and the built environment, so any project that examines that is likely something of interest!  
## course objectives
From this course, I'm hoping to gain greater confidence cleaning, analyzing, and presenting urban data. Essentially, I'm looking to build tangible technical skills that will allow me to create compelling maps and data visualizations moving forward!
